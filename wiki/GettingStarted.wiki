= Setup of a build environment =

== Prerequisites ==

 * Apache Maven 3.0.3+
 * Tomcat 7+


== Maven dependencies ==

 * [http://cxf.apache.org/ Apache CXF]
 * [http://jersey.java.net/ Jersey]
 * JSR-311
 * [http://code.google.com/p/utils-apl-derived/ utils-apl-derived](other project)

== Checkout source from SVN == 

Checkout source from SVN for this projects and the *utils-apl-derived* project.

Import the projects into Eclipse via the *Import existing Maven projects..." wizard

== Dependency: utils-apl-derived ==

The utils-apl-derived project is basically a library containing utility classes. Since it is not available in Maven Repo1 yet, it has to be compiled, too.

This can be done by checking it out and compile and install it with "mvn clean install" at console level.

This utils project offers some of the JAXB delegate classes to wrap arbitrary maps and lists, as well as a possibility to log data directly into Microsoft Excel xls files.

== Project overview ==

The projects are grouped into a Apache Maven nested module project.
The root project is called:
 * webservice-evaluation
and it includes following nested module projects:
 * client-apache-cxf
 * client-jersey
 * webapp-apache-cxf
 * webapp-jersey
 
The client projects are representing REST clients. They include JUnit test cases which simulates a client by requesting data from the web application projects.

The webapp projects are deployable web applications which have to be deployed into a tomcat to allow the client projects JUnit tests to be runnable.

== Deploy webapps into an Eclipse integrated Tomcat ==

== Configuration of the clients ==

The Apache CXF client factory has to be configured with a valid url address pointing towards the running web application projects.

This can be achieved in the following file:

The ports there have to match your Apache Tomcat ports.
